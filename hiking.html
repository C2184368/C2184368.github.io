  <h1>Various hikes are available throughout San Diego County:</h1>
  
  <h3>Lake Poway + Potato Chip Rock</h3>
  <p>Lake Poway is a reservoir and dam to the east of the city of Poway. The loop around the lake is mostly flat cpmpared to the steep hikes in surrounding trails, and good for non-hikers at a length of 2.7 miles.  The loop also links up to the Mount Woodson trail, where the popular photo site Potato Chip Rock sits at, although the round trip hike would go up to 6.6 miles.<br>
    <h3>El Capitan</h3>
    <p>El Cajon Mountain and El Capitan County Preserve lie to the northwest of Lakeside, right on the edge of Cleveland National Forest. Since the hike through the Preserve is 11 miles with little shade, it is closed to recreational activity during summer months. <br>
<h3>Julian</h3>
<p>The mountainous community of Julian lies along State Highway 78. Forest trails and old mining roads offer 1-5 mile hikes outside of the small town. They also grow apples and sell apple pies during autumn.<br>
