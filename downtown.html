  <h1>Available in the Downtown area just minutes from the airport, there are multiple things to do:</h1>
  
  <h3>Gaslamp Quarter + Little Italy</h3>
  <p>Spanning roughly 8 blocks north-to-south, the Gaslamp Quarter is full of nightlife activities. You will also see it on the way to either Petco Park or the San Diego Convention Center.<br>
    Little Italy is northwest of the Gaslamp Quarter and southeast of the airport. It is filled with Italian restaurants and runs community events throughout the year.<br>
    <h3>Balboa Park</h3>
    <p>On the eastern side of I-5, Balboa Park is home to multiple museums and gardens. The biggest non-city-attraction is the San Diego Zoo.  It also hosts the outdoor Spreckels Organ Pavillion with outdoor concerts.<br>
<h3>Ferry to Coronado</h3>
<p>Coronado Island is a short ferry ride away from the Embarcadero next to the Convention Center. Alternately, cars can drive over the bay using Highway 75. The island is home to Hotel Del Coronado as well as Coronado Beach and Silver Strand State Beach.<br>
<h3>Cabrillo National Monument</h3>
<p>On the edge of Point Loma and 15 minutes west of the airport, Cabrillo National Monument is a part of the National Parks system.  There is access to the Point Loma Tide Pools, the historic lighthouse, and various nature trails offering ocean views.</p><br>
