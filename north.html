  <h1>The County of San Diego stretches far to the north</h1>
  
  <h3>Beach Town Walking</h3>
  <p>Multiple small cities line the beaches of San Diego County. Roughly one hour north of the airport, some of the bigger attractions include Oceanside Pier and Carlsbad Flower Fields.  There are also many places to park, walk, and eat along Encinitas, Solana Beach, and Del Mar. <br>
    <h3>Legoland</h3>
    <p>Legoland also resides in Carlsbad. In addition to lego sculptures, there are a variety of rides and shows within the park.  There is a water park open during summer months as well.<br>
<h3>Palomar Observatory</h3>
<p>Further inland and at 5500 ft elevation, the Palomar Observatory houses the Hale Telescope.  The observatory staff have developed self-guided tours, as well as public tours during the spring and summer months.</p>
